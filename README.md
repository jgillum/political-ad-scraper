political-ad-scraper
====================

A Ruby scraper for grabbing political ads uploaded to YouTube, archiving them and sending an alert email.

<h2>Background</h2>
This tool, to be run on a regular interval, allows you to scrape YouTube using youtube-dl for political ads that campaigns and super PACs upload. It stores a copy of the file locally, updates a database and sends an alert of newly posted ads.
